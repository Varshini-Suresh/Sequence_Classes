This directory consists of: 

1. A Python package containing a set of classes: 
(1) A sequence superclass providing functionality to DNASequence and Protein subclasses 
(2) A Fasta class for parsing fasta files, which can create DNASequence or Proteins objects

2. A "maincode" Python script file that uses a test FASTA file to create objects and apply certain methods from the above classes

3. The test FASTA file contaning 5 short DNA sequences

4. The sample output file created from the maincode, showing the protein translation of the given DNA sequence in FASTA format
